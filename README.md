# Literature Review on HCI and Education

This repository includes lists of papers, along with short descriptions and a link for each, on a set of CS topics related to HCI and Education.
The lists are by no means exhaustive. All the data are collected by a human (me :) ) and without using crawlers or automated software. The lists can help you - as a researcher - get ideas for the possible citations and related work for your own paper, and to find what the previous work done on your desired topic is. In addition to the terms and conditions in the **license file**, you have to **cite this repository** in case you cite any paper in the lists in this repository after looking at the list. Also, you're **not allowed to write any kind of survey or literature review** based on the collected papers in this repository; the only papers allowed to use and cite this repository are research papers, which can use the provided lists while writing the "Related Work" section.

In case you think any description is wrong, or want to add or suggest other papers, you can open a pull request.
